- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this project I learned how to configure tailwind for custom theme using ``` tailwind.config.js ``` and It is great option when we worked with well defined design.

I will explore more about React features and using tailwind with optimal way.
